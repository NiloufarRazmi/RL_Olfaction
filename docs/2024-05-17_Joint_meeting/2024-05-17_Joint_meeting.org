* Hypothesis & directions {{{faicon(question-circle)}}}
** What do we want to know?
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_act: [<+->]
:END:
- Understand what the network learns
  \to What *function* does it learns?
- How the constrains of the task affect learning & the representations learned?
- Does the network learn something related to the real neurons? (million {{{faicon(dollar)}}}{{{faicon(dollar)}}}{{{faicon(dollar)}}} question)
** Compositional hypothesis
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_act: [<+->]
:END:
- Does the network learn a generalizable policy? \to\nbsp{}How to test it?
  - From indexed locations (current) to coordinate system
  - Merged actions space
** Compositional hypothesis

** Implementation

* Experiments & expected results {{{faicon(eyedropper)}}} {{{faicon(area-chart)}}}
** 1) How training impacts the representations learned?
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_act: [<+->]
:END:
- Feed both coordinates information (Cartesian & polar) to the input layer (+ merge actions spaces in a common one)
- Train on left/right task \to we expect the weights are close to zero on Cartesian representation?
- Train on east/west task \to we expect the weights are close to zero on polar representation?
- Not clear to me how to extract/define which neurons belong/contribute to Cartesian/polar representation
** 1) How training impacts the representations learned?

** 2) Does the network learn a coordinate system?
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_act: [<+->]
:END:
1. After training, move the population of agents in a translated coordinate system
   \to we expect the population of agents to be able to solve the task with zero shot learning
2. Train with both coordinates information (Cartesian & polar), after training feed incorrect polar angles
   - On the left/right task \to we expect the population of agents still solves the task consistently
   - On the east/west task \to we expect the network won't converge to a stable policy (i.e all the agents don't solve the task consistently)
** 2) Does the network learn a coordinate system?

*** TODO Heatmap of all the units :noexport:
- Function from angle to neural activations
- Y: Layer activations
- X: deviation from the angle that should have been predicted
** 3) Conjunctive odor-place coding
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_act: [<+->]
:END:
- Train a population of agents, then after training, flip odor A and odor B in the task
- In general we expect to find a population of conjunctive neurons that get active with the combination of both odor and specific location
- Do the conjunctive cells get conserved or remapped? (Not clear to me, I'd expect they get remapped)

:END:
1. Rewrite the environment(s) {{{faicon(star)}}}{{{faicon(star)}}}{{{faicon(star-o)}}}
   1. Code logic for new environment {{{col($\textasciitilde$1 week)}}}
   2. Check everything works as expected (unit testing) {{{col($\textasciitilde$1 week)}}}
   3. Bugs? {{{col($\textasciitilde$1 week)}}}
2. Baseline training on new environment (convergence, hyperparameter tweaking, etc.) {{{faicon(star)}}}{{{faicon(star)}}}{{{faicon(star)}}}{{{faicon(warning)}}} {{{col(1 week -- 1 month)}}}
3. Experiments
   1. Task code {{{faicon(star)}}}{{{faicon(star-o)}}}{{{faicon(star-o)}}} {{{col($\textasciitilde$1 week)}}}
   2. Training {{{faicon(star)}}}{{{faicon(star)}}}{{{faicon(star-o)}}}{{{faicon(warning)}}} {{{col($\textasciitilde$2 week)}}}
   3. Analysis code {{{faicon(star)}}}{{{faicon(star)}}}{{{faicon(star-o)}}} {{{col($\textasciitilde$2 week)}}}

** TODO Meeting
Move 31 May to 17th June
1.5h
11am
Niloufar/Matt
Alex grant presentation after 17th?
** DONE Sketch steps
*** How that changes in the coordinate systems
*** Instead of static
*** Leave the static sketch on the left
*** What does it change? What do we gain?
** DONE No one-hot encoded, need to be x & y
** Probabilistic population coding?
10 neurons how it represent
** Polar
*** From north
*** From reward port
** 3 polar + 3 cartesian
***
** Continuous values for angles
** Check DQN continuous/discrete
** Third layer tuned to?
*** Identify neurons type cart/polar sensitive
*** Is this neuron sensitive to polar input
*** Give it all possible inputs
*** Function that auto identify the tuning
** Incorrect angle \to what does it mean?
** Polar fplip north to South
** Add more tiles -5 to 5 every 1 \to -5 to 5 every 0.5
Network should have learn something else than digits
** How many variations of agents are needed
** Table with conditions
** Keep polar in the same direction for now when changing
** 2 to 5 different conditions, which ones?
** Step two: train network
** Steps 3: only inference
