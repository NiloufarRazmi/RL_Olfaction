#+TITLE: Implementation discussion
#+SUBTITLE: Cartesian/polar duplicated coordinates experiment

* Status
** Status
- Environment: done
  - Main class with origin (0,0) at the center of the environment
  - Subclass that converts the coordinates of the agent to North & South ports in Cartesian and polar coordinates
  - 44 unit tests to check that the code does what it's supposed to do and that the agent is where it's supposed to be
- Visualization: WIP
- Training: to-do
* Discussion
** Should there be a backward action?

** Length rounding in polar coordinates?
- For step 1 tiles
- For step 0.5 tiles
[[file:img/polar-discretized-length.drawio.pdf]]
** Which architecture for the network?
- 2 tasks (East/West & Left/Right)
- upper/lower triangle
- 4 head directions
- 5 discretized x coordinates (Cartesian)
- 5 discretized y coordinates (Cartesian)
- 360 discretized angles (polar)
- 50 discretized lengths (polar)
