#+title: Motivation
* RL
** RL is a general framework for sequential decision making under uncertainty
** Known RL algorithms may need lots of data to solve large MDPs, limiting practical deployment.
* Why model
** Posit: You understand a system if you can simulate it
** If you have a good enough model you may uncover mechanisms that explain a phenomena
*** Without a model \to you're limited to describe the *how*
*** With a model \to you may be able to explain the *why*
** Test hypothesis
** Abstraction of the system
Makes you think of the parameters/inputs/outputs
** Find out what is needed to reproduce experimental results, what explains those results
